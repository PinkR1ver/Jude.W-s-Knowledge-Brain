# 💯Score

This guide is scored on a five-point scale.
* This guide has a *tough scoring scale*, with 2.5 being a normal score for this guide.
* This guide has a particular focus on *value for money*, and will consider the pricing of any dish to be reasonable.
* Environment and service attitude will even outweigh the flavor level in this guide.
* The score is **highly subjective!!!** , filled with intense emotional hues and exaggerated expressions

# 🏆Trophies

The trophy mechanism is separate from the scoring, so if a restaurant has something special, whether it's the food or the service, it has a chance to win different trophies.

Here's the requirements for obtaining the trophy:
