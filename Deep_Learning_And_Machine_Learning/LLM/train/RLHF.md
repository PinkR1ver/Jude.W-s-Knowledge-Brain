# Review: Reinforcement Learning Basics

Reinforcement learning is a mathematical framework. 

Demystify the reinforcement learning model, it's a open-ended model using reward function to optimize agent to solve complex task in target environment.

# Origins of RLHF

## Pre Deep RL

Before, Deep RL don't use neural network to represent policy. What this system did was a machine learning system that created a policy by having humans label the actions that an agent took as being kind of correct or incorrect. This was just a simple decision rule where humans labeled every actions as good or bad.  This was essentially a reward model and a policy put together.

## For Deep RL

# Step by Step

For RLHF training method, here are three core steps:

1. Pretraining a language model
2. Gathering data(问答数据) and training a reward model
3. Fine-tuning the LM with reinforcement learning

## Step 1. Pretraining Language Models

Read this to learn how to train a LM:

[Pretraining language models](Deep_Learning_And_Machine_Learning/LLM/train/train_LLM.md)

OpenAI used a smaller version of GPT-3 for its first popular RLHF model - InstructGPT.

Nowadays, RLHF is new area, there's no answer to which model is the best for starting point of RLHF and using expensive augmented data to fine-tune is not necessarily.

## Step 2. Reward model training

In reward model, we integrate human preferences into the system.
