# Structure

* Conductor is located at the center of the cable
* Other layers is to protect

## Conductor Material

* Sliver
* Copper
* Aluminum
* Nickel
* Tin

### Aluminum

#### Pros

* Lightweight
* Affordable
* wide-range used in projects

#### Cons

* Less conductive than copper, another popular option

### Copper

#### Pros

* Moves electricity quickly
* inexpensive
* versatile
* In addition to being used bare, copper can also be dipped. Coating the copper with another metal can enhance specific qualities necessary for different applications.
	* For example, in tinned copper, the layer of tin protects the copper from corrosion at high temperatures and makes the wire last longer.
	* Tinned copper is easier to solder than bare copper, without a huge increase in cost.

### Silver

#### Pros

* The most conductive
* Using silver-plated wire 
	* Can reduce budget and can still provide many of the excellent conductive qualities of silver
	* Wide temperature range,
		* $-65 \degree \text{C} \leftrightarrow 200 \degree \text{C}$    
		* Used in aerospace applications
#### Cons

* High price

### Nickel

#### Pros

* Used in Nickel-plated wire
	* Operate in extreme conditions
	* Wide temperature range
		* If the nickel-plated is thick, it can withstand temperatures up to $750\degree \text{C}$ 
* Excellent corrosion resistance

## Conductor configure


> [!tip] 
>  Conductor is not what they're made of that makes them different, it's also how they're configured


### Solid or Stranrded

Chinese translation: 实心导体和绞合导体

<center><strong>Solid Conductor is in left, Stranded Conductor is in right</strong></center>


#### Solid

* Solid conductors are made of one piece of metal
* Inexpensive
* mechanically tough
* Not flexible

#### Stranded

* Stranded conductors are made of several threads of metal
* Flexible
* a little more expensive
* The Better flexibility can make a big difference in many applications

### Stranded Constructions

* Bunched Stranded Conductor
* Concentric Lay Stranded Conductor
* Uni-lay Stranded Conductor
* Rope-lay Stranded  Conductor

#### Bunched Stranded Conductor

Bunched strands are simply gathered together without any specific arrangement.

* Inexpensive

#### Concentric Lay Stranded Conductor

In concentric stranding, the layers alternate in terms of their twist direction.
