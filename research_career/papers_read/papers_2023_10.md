# Measurements of UWB through-the-wall propagation using spectrum analyzer and the Hilbert transform

## DOI

[https://doi.org/10.1002/mop.23107](https://doi.org/10.1002/mop.23107)
## Abstract

本文讲解了如何利用spectrum analyzer去测量UWB穿墙特性。本文的关键点在于利用Hilbert变换去**retrieve phase information**。这样就可以不使用昂贵的VNA设备去进行UWB穿墙特性的测量。

## Key Point

1. "**Channel measurements** for communication applications are **usually performed in the frequency domain** because of the *availability of the required instrumentations*, *the moderate cost*, and the *large associated dynamic range.*"

2. "For **narrowband channel characterization**, the **phase data are less important** because the phase can be approximated as a linear phase component. For **UWB channels,** however, the **phase is a critical parameter** and the nature of its variations with frequency over an ultra-wide bandwidth can significantly impact the time-domain response."

	* If the delay is not constant for different frequency components, the received signal will be distorted. - **群延时性**

	* 本文就利用Hibert transform获得phase information

4. Even for VNA, phase information is hard acquire. 
	* **Bad environment**, Long distance and wall obstructions
	* Synchronization feedback cable should be **very low loss at the upper frequency edge**. - *明白了但仍未从逻辑上理解*
	* Phase measurements are quite **sensitive**, in-situ measurements' error will skew result
	* **Transmitter receiver crosstalk** will result in precursors in the impulse response
