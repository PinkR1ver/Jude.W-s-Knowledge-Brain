Conway's Law is essentially the observation that the **architectures of software systems look remarkably similar to the organization of the development team** that built it. It was originally described to me by saying that if a single team writes a compiler, it will be a one-pass compiler, but if the team is divided into two, then it will be a two-pass compiler. Although we usually discuss it with respect to software, the observation applies broadly to systems in general.
