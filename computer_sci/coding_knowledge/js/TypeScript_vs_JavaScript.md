**1. Typing:**

- **TypeScript:** Statically typed. You need to explicitly define the data types of variables and functions. This helps catch errors early in the development process.
- **JavaScript:** Dynamically typed. Variables don't require explicit data type definition. This offers flexibility but can lead to runtime errors.

**2. Features:**

- **TypeScript:** Adds features like interfaces, classes, generics, and enums on top of JavaScript. These features improve code organization, readability, and maintainability for larger projects.
- **JavaScript:** Lacks these features but has a vast ecosystem of libraries that can provide similar functionalities.

**3. Compilation:**

- **TypeScript:** Needs to be compiled to JavaScript before running in a browser. This compilation step adds another step to the development process.
- **JavaScript:** Runs directly in the browser without any compilation needed.

**4. Choosing Between TypeScript and JavaScript:**

- **TypeScript:** Ideal for large-scale applications, projects requiring strong typing and better tooling support, and teams working collaboratively.
- **JavaScript:** Preferred for smaller projects, rapid prototyping, or when flexibility and faster turnaround time are priorities.
