# Hyper Parameters

## Kernel Function

* Linear
* Polynomial
* RBF
	* $\gamma$: The gamma parameter **defines the influence of each training example on the decision boundary**. A higher gamma value gives more weight to the closer points, while a lower value allows points further away to have a significant impact. Higher values of gamma can lead to overfitting, especially in datasets with noise.
## C Parameter

The C parameter, also known as the regularization parameter, controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. **A smaller C value allows for a larger margin but may lead to misclassification of some training examples, while a larger C value focuses on classifying all training examples correctly but might result in a narrower margin**
## [Training Method](https://wadhwatanya1234.medium.com/multi-class-classification-one-vs-all-one-vs-one-993dd23ae7ca)

* One-vs-All
* One-vs-One
# Detail

## Score Function

$$
f(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i y_i G(x, x_i) + bias
$$
* $\alpha_i$ is corresponding support vector weight
* $y_i$ is corresponding support vector tags
* $G(x,x_i)$ is kernel function about input sample $x$ and support vector $x_i$
* $bias$ is bias
## Decision Function 

$$
Decision \ Function = sign(f(x))
$$
We determine the sample's category by checking its decision function's sign.
