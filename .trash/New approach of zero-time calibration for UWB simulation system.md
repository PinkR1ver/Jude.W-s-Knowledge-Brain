## Abstract

## INTRODUCTION

With the rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) has demonstrated immense potential in the fields of short-range wireless communication and precise positioning due to its high time resolution and low power consumption characteristics. Antenna delay in UWB nodes is one of the critical factors affecting positioning accuracy. Therefore, developing an effective antenna delay calibration method is essential for enhancing the performance of UWB positioning systems.
